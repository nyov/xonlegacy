The following is an extract from the README file
of the Unicode utilities package, as published at
http://unifoundry.com/unicode-utilities.html


Subject: Unifont archive version 1:5.1.20080907


OVERVIEW
--------
The Unifont is a dual-width (8x16/16x16) bitmap font, designed to provide
coverage for all of Unicode Plane 0, the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
This version has a glyph for each visible code point in the Unicode 5.1
Basic Multilingual Plane.

Note that this version of the Unifont only provides a single glyph
for each character, making it impossible to handle any language that
needs context-dependent character shaping well. It is supplied in the
form of a hex file, with a converter to convert it to bdf. See
http://czyborra.com/unifont/ or http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html
for more information.


unifont AUTHORS
---------------
Roman Czyborra created the original GNU Unifont, including the
.hex format.  For greater detail, see the HISTORY section below.

David Starner aggregated many glyphs contributed by others and
built these into earlier unifont releases.

Qianqian Fang began his Wen Quan Yi fonts in 2004; most of the
almost 30,000 CJK ideographs in the latest unifont were taken
from Wen Quan Yi with permission of Qianqian Fang.  The glyphs
in "./font/hexsrc/wqy-cjk.hex" are for the most part Qianqian
Fang's unibit and 12pt Wen Quan Yi glyphs.

Changwoo Ryu created the 11,172 thick-stroke Hangul Syllables glyphs
using thin-stroke glyphs from the xfonts-baekmuk Debian package, in
the file unifont.bdf in the Debian bf-utf-source package.  The fonts
in the xfonts-baekmuk Debian package were created by Jeong-Hwan Kim.
Replacing the thick-stroke Hangul glyphs was a desire expressed by
Roman Czyborra for years.

Paul Hardy merged Qianqian Fang's unibit and Wen Quan Yi glyphs
into the GNU Unifont (with lots of help and enthusiasm from Qianqian
Fang), copied the Hangul Syllables glyphs from Changwoo Ryu's copy
of unifont.bdf, drew about 8,500 more glyphs, and replaced the
existing Tibetan glyphs with new ones contributed by Rich Felker.

David Starner released what in this package is named "hex2bdf-split"
under the same license as Roman Czyborra's work.

License for all of Paul Hardy's work (except "johab2ucs2" and

     License version 2, or (at your option) a later version.

License for Fonts:

     Any fonts using glyphs from the "wqy-cjk.hex" file (including
     the default TrueType font) are bound by the terms of the Wen
     Quan Yi font license.  Those fonts are released under the terms
     of the GNU General Public License (GPL) versionn 2, with the
     exception that embedding the font in a document does not by
     itself bind that document to the terms of the GNU GPL.

     Any fonts that do not use glyphs from the "wqy-cjk.hex" file
     fall under the above "License for all of Roman Czyborra's work".

     The fonts in "./font/precompiled" do use wqy-cjk.hex, and so
     are licensed under the GNU GPL version 2, with the exception
     that embedding the font in a document does not in itself bind
     that document to the terms of the GNU GPL.  The following
     paragraphs explaining the exception is taken from the Wen
     Quan Yi font distribution:

          ** GPL v2.0 license with font embedding exception:

          As a special exception, if you create a document which
          uses this font, and embed this font or unaltered portions
          of this font into the document, this font does not by
          itself cause the resulting document to be covered by
          the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
          however invalidate any other reasons why the document
          might be covered by the GNU General Public License.
          If you modify this font, you may extend this exception
          to your version of the font, but you are not obligated
          to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this
          exception statement from your version.

License for "blanks.hex":

     There is one exception to the above rules: Paul Hardy earlier
     released the "blanks.hex" file into the public domain.


HISTORY
-------
Roman Czyborra <roman@czybora.com> began the GNU Unifont in 1998
as a low quality font to provide a glyph for every Unicode character
in the Basic Multilingual Plane.  He realized that no one font at
the time had complete coverage of the Unicode BMP.  Czyborra.com still
has several cool tools for the unifont not included here.

Since Roman Czyborra was unable to maintain the Unifont for a while,
and many patches existed on gnu-unifont@groups.yahoo.com
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gnu-unifont), David Starner
<dstarner98@aasaa.ofe.org> decided to make a new release extending the
Unifont with many characters in 1999.  That was the foundation of earlier
GNU Unifont releases in Debian.

By 2004, work had stopped on the GNU Unifont.  Qianqian Fang wanted to
create a high-quality Chinese Unicode font in 2004.  He began by copying
the GNU Unifont.  He replaced its Latin glyphs with another X11 font.
He replaced the existing main CJK ideographs with a higher quality font
that the People's Republic of China had placed in the public domain.
The new CJK glyphs in the ranges U+3400..U+4DB5 and U+4E00..U+9FA5
were developed from the Chinese National Standard GB19966-2005.

Qianqian named this new font "unibit", and released it under the terms
of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2, with the exception that
embedding his font in a document did not by itself bind that document
to the terms of the GNU GPL.

Today the Wen Quan Yi font collection includes hand-drawn CJK ideographs
in 9pt, 10pt, 11pt, and 12pt as well as a vector font.  The 12pt type
has glyphs the same size as the GNU Unifont, except it adds two more
pixels of leading (blank space) below each line.  This makes CJK easier
to read.  For these reasons, Wen Quan Yi is recommended over the GNU Unifont
for anyone planning to primarily use CJK ideographs.

See http://wqy.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/enindex.cgi (English) or
http://wenq.org (Chinese) for more information on Wen Quan Yi.

In 2006, the GNU Unifont package was orphaned in Debian.

In late 2007, Paul Hardy became interested in adding to the GNU Unifont.
He wrote a couple of programs to convert GNU Unifont .hex files to and
from bitmap images for easy editing with any graphics software.  He began
by combining the latest glyphs available for the GNU Unifont.  This
starting point was posted at http://czyborra.com as the 2007-12-31 version
of unifont.hex.  Shortly after that, Roman Czyborra's website went down.
Paul Hardy then started posting complete copies of GNU Unifont on his
website, "http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html".

Roman Czyborra encouraged Paul Hardy to continue this work on GNU Unifont.

In early 2008, Paul Hardy learned of Qianqian Fang's work.  Qianqian
encouraged a combining of effort, and Paul Hardy at that point created
two versions of the GNU Unifont: one with the original Chinese ideographs
(which Roman Czyborra copied from a Japanese font in the public domain),
and one with Qianqian Fang's Wen Quan Yi (Spring of Letters) ideographs.
The Wen Quan Yi font provides far more coverage of CJK ideographs than
the original Japanese font did, and is of higher quality.

Paul Hardy created a version of both the font with the original CJK
ideographs from Japan and with CJK ideographs from Wen Quan Yi that
contained combining circles.  He then wrote a post-processing program
to remove the combining circles from the final font.

In 2005, Luis Gonzalez Miranda (http://www.lgm.cl) created a set of
Fontforge scripts and Perl programs.  Paul Hardy modified Luis' software
in 2008 to cover the full Unicode 5.1 Basic Multilingual Plane range.
Luis gave Paul Hardy permission to release this modified version under
the terms of "the GNU General Public License, version 2 or (at your
option) a later version."

On 4 July 2008, Paul Hardy was looking through all of Roman Czyborra's
Perl scripts.  One of these, "braille", contained a comment from 2003
that the original GNU Unifont did not generate its Braille patterns
(U+2800..U+28FF) correctly.  The modified script fixed that bug.  Paul
Hardy incorporated the correct Braile glyphs into the 6 July 2008
release of the GNU Unifont.  All previous versions probably contain
this Braille bug and should be replaced.

Other notable additions include:

     - Incorporation of CJK glyphs from Qianqian Fang's fonts
     - Incorporation of Rich Felker's Tibetan glyphs
     - Replacement of the Hangul Syllables block with a thin stroke font
       (Roman had mentioned wanting to do this someday on his website)
     - Addition of circled pencil glyphs for the Private Use Area
       (suggested as an accpetable rendering in the Unicode 5.0 Standard)
     - Proper handling of combining characters in the TrueType version
     - Proper handling of space glyphs in the TrueType version

The hex2bdf script in this release is Roman's original script, not the
modified version that produced two BDF files (one for 8 pixel wide glyphs
and another for 16 pixel wide glyphs).  The TrueType font should be used
in preference to the BDF font, so this is probably a moot point.  Debian
doesn't even allow BDF fonts to be installed any longer; the Debian Policy
Manual now states that BDF fonts must be converted to PCF format.  The
only program that might still benefit from the BDF font is Yudit, which
works with a single, dual-width unifont.bdf file.
